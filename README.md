## Experience

**Federal Trade Commission / Technologist** _09/15-present_
- Assist attorneys on technical aspects of security, privacy, and fraud investigations. Substantially contributed to multiple investigations leading to novel security & privacy actions and remedies. Such settlements have amounted to over 38,000 times my annual salary. 
- Conduct technical research on security, privacy, and fraud topics that impact consumers. For example, published research on cross-device tracking has been cited over 50 times and was presented as part of an FTC workshop. 
- Educate attorneys and investigators on i) the latest relevant technical research; ii) investigative techniques for security, privacy, and fraud investigations; iii) foundational technical concepts (e.g. How DNS works); and more. Presentations and techniques have been used to improve decision making and make certain law enforcement investigations more efficient.
